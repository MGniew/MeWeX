% Shared library available in C++ and package for Python offer same method with similar syntax - method Lemmatize with parameters :\begin{itemize}
% \item inflected phrase
% \item base form of words space-separated
% \item tags of words space-separated
% \item boolean values if the words of phrase should be space-separated
% \item phrase category
% \end{itemize}
% Command-line tool takes tsv file as an input. Each line consist of proper lemma of a phrase, an inflected phrase, base forms of words from the phrase, tags of each word, boolean values if there should be space after each word and a category of a phrase e.g.

% 	\caption{Lemmatization Module Input}
% 	%\label{polem_input}
% \end{figure}
        
% Evaluation is based on comparing the proper lemma that was given at input to the result of the lemmatization. Output of the module is also a tsv file with effectiveness of the lemmatization calculated. Each line consists of a boolean value if the lemmatization of the phrase was conducted successfully, inflected phrase, proper lemma of the phrase, category, method that was used to lemmatize given phrase, base form of words in phrase and tags e.g.

% 	\caption{Lemmatization Module Output}
% 	%\label{polem_Output}
% \end{figure}
% At the end of the file the summary of the lemmatization is given concerning the method of lemmatization and concerning the category of phrases. Each method or category is listed with an amount of phrases successfully and unsuccessfully lemmatized, effectiveness and coverage of all phrases by given method or category e.g.

% MorfGeo Lemmatizer is another dictionary lemmatizer however file that it uses as dictionary is a list of inflected geological names and locations with their lemmas. NamLivPerson lemmatizer is partial dictionary and partial rule lemmatizer as it uses both dictionary and rules to generate or find lemmas. Dictionary that it also taken from the Nelexicon tool however it consists only of phrases related to and of human full names. Rules for inflection for NamLivPerson are in a form of list with tag of an inflected phrase, ending of an inflected phrase, ending of lemma of the phrase and numerical value that represents frequency of given ending occurring in texts. NamLoc lemmatizer uses only inflection rules to generate lemmas. Rules are in identical form as in NamLivPerson lemmatizer, the only difference between NamLoc and NamLivPerson rule-based part is the category of phrases and dictionary file. Rule Lemmatizer uses rules developed by Ph.D. Marczinczuk and described in "Lemmatization of Multi-word Common Noun Phrases and Named Entities in Polish" paper. //TODO CHANGE AFOREMENTIONED SENTENCE// Rules are in a form of XML DOM file and consists of constraints and transformations. Constraints are encoded using WCCL formalism. Sample rule : 
        
% After entering values, process goes into Nelexicon Lemmatizer part. Dictionary file is searched for lemma for given phrase. If lemma is found the process returns result otherwise process proceeds to MorfGeo Lemmatizer and searches the dictionary file for lemma. When lemma is not found and category of the phrase matches person's name category process starts NamLivPerson Lemmatizer and searches its dictionary file and in case lemma is still not found inflection rules are applied in such manner, that if tag and ending of a word fits the rule, the ending of a lemma from the rule with highest occurrence value is taken and lemma is generated by replacing word's ending with ending from the rule. Phrases are dismembered into words before searching for fitting rule. Lemma is found when there is a rule for every word in a phrase. When taking into consideration the occurrence values, only rules with values higher then certain value are used. If lemma is not found and category of the phrase matches location, NamLoc Lemmatizer is started. For every word in phrase rules of lemmatizer are searched for in same manner that in NamLivPerson rule-based part.  //TODO
