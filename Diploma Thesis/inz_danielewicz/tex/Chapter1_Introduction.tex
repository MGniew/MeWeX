\section{Definition of collocation}

% Trudność jednoznacznego i ścisłego zdefiniowania kolokacji została opisana w obrazowy
% sposób przez Choueka i przytoczona przez Stefana Everta – Even though any two lexicogra-
% phers would agree that ’once upon a time’, ’hit the road’ and similar idioms are collocations,
% they would most certainly disagree on almost anything else. [8, str. 15]. Cytat ten jest metafo-
% rą obrazującą bardzo niską korelację oceny wyrażeń wielowyrazowych jako kolokacji, nawet
% pomiędzy lingwistami.
% Na przestrzeni ponad osiemdziesięciu ostatnich lat definicja terminu kolokacja była wielo-
% krotnie modyfikowana, dostosowywana i poddawana uszczegółowieniu co sprawiło, że poja-
% wiło się wiele jej wersji

Precise defining collocation is not a simple task. This problem was nicely illustrated by Choueka in Stefan Evert book

\textit {Even though any two lexicographers would agree that ’once upon a time’, ’hit the road’ and similar idioms are collocations,
they would most certainly disagree on almost anything else.}
Lexicographers argued over the years on correct defining what collocation is and because of that there is not one fixed definition of collocation  
and in relevant literature we can find many different versions but most of them have one common characteristic, 
collocation is a multiword expression that are syntactically and/or semantically idiomatic. Because this thesis will base on MeWeX system 
it assumes the same definition as in Michał Wendelberger thesis, for which purpose MeWeX was created.

\\ \textit{Collocation is a multiword specialistic term or noncompositional general term. 
It may be both continous or not and both in fixed or flexible order.} \\
% Za wyrażenie wielowyrazowe uznawane są wieloelementowe terminy specjalistyczne oraz
% niekompozycyjne terminy ogólne. Mogą być one zarówno ciągłe, w szyku przemiennym, jak i
% ustalonym.
This definition was motivated by similarity to others definitions used by lexicographers and it fits the needs for creating polish MWE dictionary (lexicon). 

\section{Methods for extraction of collocations}
Automatic extraction of collocations is a very hard task. First of all precise specification of collocation is required.
Method of extraction is dependent on choosen definition of MWE but also on other factors like language. 
Even having precisly specified all conditions it may be performed in many different ways. 
Usually finding MWE is done in three steps. At first candidates for collocation are extracted from the text using some rules and filters, 
which most often base on grammar of given language. Second step is to evaluate quality of the candidates 
using some association measure or more sophisticated algorithms and sorting it according to obtained values. 
Finally collocations are choosen from generated ranking. Method used in MeWeX fits in mentioned above general way, 
more detailed description is included in section \ref{mewex_workflow}.

\section{MeWex}

\subsection{General description}
MeWeX is a system designed for extraction of collocations. It is designed as a set of separate programs 
that preforms consequitive parts of extraction process, but it can be also used as a programmatic library in other projects. 
This design gives huge flexibility, because it allows to run given part many times in different setup, 
or to preprocess large data and save result of every step. This capabilities are very useful in conducting reaserch. 
It is also helpful in natural language processing where often size of data is very large, so possibility 
to preprocess input once and repeating further stages many times with different setup can save a lot of time.

\subsection{Structure of the program}
MeWeX has a lot functionalities, so to preserve clear and maintainable code it has expanded stucture. 
This also simplify further extensions and modifications of the system.

All functionalities are provided as a set of programs that together creates complete tool for collocation extraction,
verification of the results, tunning weigths, text analysis etc.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TuplesBuilder} - Program that reads corpora given as an input and using wccl operators given in input file 
    it creates candidates for collocations.

    \item \textbf{Indexer}
 
    \item \textbf{Normalizer}

\section{Scope of the thesis}

\subsection{General}
Purpose of this thesis is to improve efficiency of the MeWeX. Due to complexity of this system this task 
will consist of few parts listed in sections below.

\subsection{Test association measure functions}
First step is to perform unit test of association measures implementation. Author of the MeWeX did not prepared unit test for this part, 
so there is possibility, that those functions are incorrectly implemented. Errors generated on this stage will propagate in following data process, 
so it can "uniemożliwiać" improving further stages. That way it is important to start with checking correctness of the implementation 
at the beggining.

\subsection{Implement new association measures}
MeWeX was implemented in 2015r and science branch of natural language processing is developing rapidly nowadays, 
so from that time new association measures may were invented. Task for the author of this tesis is to carefully examine recently written literature 
in search of newly proposed association measures which would be suitable for rating MWE. If some measure will satisfy those condition it should 
be implemented and the last step would be to verify efficiency of that measure.

\subsection{Imlement new mechanism for training feature set for classifiers}
In MeWeX we can evaluate candidates for collocation using not only single association measure, but also aggregated score from more than one measure. 
In that case vector of measures is created and each measure has assigned weigth. Currently in MeWeX there are implemented few simple algorithms 
based on machine learning which trains vector of weigths. For purpose of this thesis new algorithm should be found and implemented.

\subsection{Train classifier on new data}
Mentioned section above algorithms for training weigths needs proper training data. This includes corpora of polish texts and set 
of proper collocations. Michał Wendelberger while working on MeWeX had quite large corpora, but insufficient set of correct MWE limited his results. 
Now in polish Wordnet there is availble much bigger set of collocations. Many of them was gathered with use of MeWeX.
Using new, more copmplete, dataset weigths for aggregators should be retrained in order to obtain better results.

\subsection{Compare new results with previous one}
Last step is to compare results achived by improved version with score that author of MeWeX achieved in his thesis.
To do that, some of the "surveys" conducted in thesis by Michał Wendelberger will be repeated with new implemented or improved features. 
Only part of "surveys" will be conducted again, because scope of this thesis does not cover all functionalities offered by MeWeX.
