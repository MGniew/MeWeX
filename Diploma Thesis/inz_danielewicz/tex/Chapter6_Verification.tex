\section{Methods of results verification}
Final stage of this thesis is to verify quality of newly implemented features. Results were measured with use of Miner program. 
It performs f-fold, r-round cross validation to evaluate given association measure or aggregator. Features which will be aim of 
this verification are C-value association measure and agregated set of measures with weigths trained by Particle Sworm Optimization. 
Same examination were conducted also for previously implemented measures to compare results.
