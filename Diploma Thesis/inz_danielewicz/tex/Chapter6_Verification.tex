\section{Methods of results verification}
Final stage of this thesis is to verify quality of newly implemented features. Results were measured with use of Miner program. 
It performs f-fold, r-round cross validation to evaluate given association measure or aggregator. Features which will be aim of 
this verification are C-value association measure and aggregated set of measures with weigths trained by Particle Sworm Optimization. 
Same examination were conducted also for previously implemented measures to compare results. As a final score average from each round 
and each fold of given validation were taken.

\section{Setup for verification}
Verification was performed with use of the datased described in section \ref{dataset}. Association measures listed below 
were used as a reference.
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Mutual Expectation
    \item Specific Frequency Biased Mutual Dependency
    \item Tscore
    \item Loglikelihood
    \item Jaccard
    \item Sorgenfrei
    \item Unigram Subtuples
    \item Specific Exponential Correlation with parameter equal to 3,8
    \item W Specific Exponential Correlation with parameter equal to 1,15
    \item W Order
    \item W Term Frequency Order
\end{itemize}
